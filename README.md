# Howl: A Lua build system

Howl is a build system for Lua, based mostly on [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake).

## HowlFiles
Howl uses Howlfiles (`Howlfile`, `Howlfile.lua`) to find tasks.
A Howlfile is just Lua. You can look at Howl's own [Howlfile](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/Howl/blob/master/Howlfile.lua)
for an example of one.
